# OpenAiRewriter
This is a Rewriter scripted using OpenAi API
This rewriter has OpenAI scripted into it so you can ask it anything, but the soul purpose was to be a Grammar checker and a Punctutuon checker. So, you will need to type in the GUI before using "rewrite this with grammar and punctuation:"

Requirements: You will need Python 3.11 or later and the required Modules, The only thing you will really need is OpenAI, so open CMD and type, "py -3.11 -m pip install openai"

If you need to upgrade OpenAI, type, "py -3.11 -m pip install --upgrade openai"

After doing so, left click once on the python file, then right click and select "Edit with Idle." After that, you will need to go to the OpenAI website and create a API key, After that, put the key in the section labeled "YOUR_API_KEY" and you should be set.

SMALL WARNNING/KNOWN BUGS: You will not be able to copy and paste. You will need to type it out yourself!
